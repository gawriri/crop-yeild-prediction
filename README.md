🌾 Crop Yield Prediction Using SARIMAX (2025–2030)

This project focuses on forecasting crop yields using the SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors) model — a powerful time series analysis technique well suited for agricultural data.

📌 Objective
To predict future yield trends of three key crops in Maharashtra:
- Bajra
- Jowar
- Maize

For the years 2025 to 2030, using historical crop production data.

 🛠️ Key Features
- Time series forecasting with SARIMAX.
- Data visualization using **Altair**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**.
- Interactive Streamlit web app to select crops and view predictions.

 📁 Files Included
- `app.py`: Streamlit app code.
- `forecast_crops_2025_2030.csv`: Forecasted crop yield data.
- `crop_yield_plot.py`: Bar/line chart visualizations.

 📊 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit
- Altair
